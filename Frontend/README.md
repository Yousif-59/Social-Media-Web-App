Welcome to our README file!

Project Idea: We're currently building a social media web application.

Team Members: Yousif Al Saadi, Brayden Roeder, Karyn Remsing, Carlo Marroquin, Jacob Sauceda

To run our code:
1- install npm by typing: npm install npm
2- Make sure you have Node.js installed
3- Run it by typing: npm start
4- By completing these steps, it should take you to a local host server with port 3000

Brayden's next step:
   - Work with backend to get the database setup as quick as possible (lots of features rely on this).
   - Begin implementeing the actual functionality of the search bar. 


   Carlo's Status: 
   - Linked Django to Firebase. I ran into major blocks ranging from my old computer being slow, to now having a set up issue on my new one, that Jacob and I may have found.

   Link: https://jas663.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEB/boards/5?selectedIssue=WEB-21
   

Carlo's next step:
   - Work on catching up my part of the back end to link to Jacob's.
   - Work with Jacob to get our codes together to creacte one backend branch on GitKraken.
   - Work with the front end group to link all our codes together.
   - Get my new laptop set up correctly.
   
   
   Jacob's status:
   - integrated Django for back end development
   Link: https://bitbucket.org/jas663first/webappfinal/commits/9ad1439223a122dd6442f1ac4f0d7dd891553aa6
   - tried to implement bootstrap tools
   Link: https://bitbucket.org/jas663first/webappfinal/commits/d666b1a16ee7974787637e0507c50825bf32b09f
   - Connected Django and react frame works

   Link 2: https://bitbucket.org/jas663first/webappfinal/commits/284b437e3d42ab9a3f97d3a91363825c7c7c85fd
   
   Jacob's next step: 
   - Ensure that front end work is properly using DJango and Firebase services to connect to back end tasks such as authentication and databasing
   - Help implement dynamic web app functionality
   - emplement other back end functions
   
Karyn's Status:
   - Implement a section in the main page where it gives you the option to create a post/tweet and be visible on the site.
   Link: https://jas663.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEB/boards/5?selectedIssue=WEB-48
   - Implement a 'Home' button in the navigation bar to return to Home page after signing in. This is would look similar to what you see on Twitter, or any other social media apps.
   Link: https://jas663.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEB/boards/5?selectedIssue=WEB-47 
   - Re-Implement home button, design and functionality after YA's 3/6/23 changes.
   Link: https://jas663.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEB/boards/5?selectedIssue=WEB-53
   - Implements a section in the post to see all the likes and comments
   Link: https://jas663.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEB/boards/5?selectedIssue=WEB-51

Karyn's Next Steps:
   - Create a way to collect likes, get with Jacob to connect database so we have real data
   - Implement link fuction to buttons that are currently not functional.
   - give substance to empty pages
   - redirect desig to be ore accodating for the average student, instead of a general user.
