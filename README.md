Welcome to my SOCIAL MEDIA WEB APP!

For this project, I worked with a team of 5 to implement a professional social media app. 

During the implementation, we used REACTJS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Database, REST APIs. 

To run the project, 
1-create 2 terminals on VSCode, one for the api, and the other for Frontend. 
2- then run the api terminal first by typing: yarn start, or npm start (Note you might need to install some of the packages related to yarn or npm)
3- Then run the Frontend by also typing yarn start or npm start. 
4- This should open up a localhost page and takes you to the sign up page of our UI
5- You need to create a username and remember it to login and enjoy our UI!
